You can follow it to the "MATLAB code section to get the rest of our codebase not included in this release file."

### Instructions to Run:
1. Make sure you have **MATLAB R2017a or later** installed. 
2. Open MATLAB, and add the entire folder (cloned repository or contents of zip file) to the path. (Right-click on parent folder and select "Add to path > Selected folders and subfolders."
3. Run "driver.m" and input the filename of the guitar tab image you want the synthesizer to play. Test images will be in the "Test Images/" directory. If you are running this program on Windows, the extension may be hidden. If you are running on a UNIX-based OS, it is necessary to include. Note that the file extension ".JPG" is in capital letters for the provided test images, so it must be specified as such on UNIX.

For example, if you want to run the program on Test Image 4, input the following when prompted:
- On Windows: 'test_image4.jpg'
- On Linux or Mac OS: 'test_image4.JPG' or 'Test Images/test_image4.JPG'
