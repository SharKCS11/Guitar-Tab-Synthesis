You can follow it to the "MATLAB code section to get the rest of our codebase not included in this release file."

### Instructions to Run:
1. Make sure you have **MATLAB R2017a or later** installed. 
2. Open MATLAB, and add the entire folder (cloned repository or contents of zip file) to the path.
3. Run "driver.m" and specify the filename of the guitar tab image you want the synthesizer to play. Test images will be in the "Test Images/" directory. If you are running this program on Windows, the extension may be hidden, so make sure to include it. Note that the file extension ".JPG" is in capital letters for the provided test images.

For example, if you want to run the program on Test Image 4, input "Test Images/test_image4.JPG" when prompted by the driver script.
